Development Environment:  
- Arduino

Hardware Requirements:
- Arduino Mega
- Cable Tester board
- Interface cables  


This simple arduino project is used to test cable integrity. It tests for shorts (undesired) between 
connector pins and connectivity between two ends of the cable. DIP switches allow for the user to 
change the pins under test on the fly, without the need to modify the software. This project was 
developed to be used on an Arduino Mega, as it has a sufficient number of pins needed. However, there 
should be no reason it can't be used on other Arduinos with the same form factor as the Mega.
